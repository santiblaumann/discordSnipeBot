# guildedSnipeBot

This bot is meant to serve as a counting mechanism for "snipes". 

In Cornell Culture (and college campuses nationally, I'd assume), a snipe is: when you see someone on campus or in public, you take a picture of them and it counts as a "snipe" if you can get a picture of them without being seen. You then post this in some dedicated snipes thread, and they get laughed at for whatever dumb thing they might have been doing. 

To up the ante, this bot is designed to keep a count of the "kill/death" ratio for snipes. When someone is tagged with an accompanying snipe picture, they gain one "kill" while the receipient receives a "death".

## Installation
This bot is meant for use in Guilded servers, as it is what we use on CU Autonomous Drone. Guilded bots are designed to be very easy to turn into Discord bots and vice versa, but **this is not a discord bot.**

You need to be running Python 3.8 or above, and must have the guilded.py package installed on your machine. To install it, run the following command:

```pip install guilded.py```

This is currently a work in progress.
