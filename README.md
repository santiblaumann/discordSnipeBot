This is a port of the guildedSnipeBot I wrote previously to Discord. If this message is still displayed, I am currently in the process of porting it over. This documentation will be updated once it is finished. 

As of current it is _working_ but I am not happy at all with the state of the codebase. 
It's messy, hard to read, and could be implemented far better. I plan to write this in a more object-oriented manner at some point. 

Scoreboard functionality to come.
